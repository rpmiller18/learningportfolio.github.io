                Aubrey Drake Graham[5] (born October 24, 1986) is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, actor, producer, and entrepreneur.[6] Gaining recognition by starring in the television series Degrassi: The Next Generation (2001â€“2007), Drake released his debut mixtape Room for Improvement in 2006; pursuing a career in music, he released the mixtapes Comeback Season (2007) and So Far Gone (2009) before signing with Young Money Entertainment.[7]

Drake released his debut studio album Thank Me Later in 2010, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200. He achieved major critical success with Take Care (2011), and commercial success with Nothing Was the Same (2013)[8] and his first commercial mixtape If You're Reading This It's Too Late (2015); the latter two were certified multi-platinum in the US.[9] Drake's fourth album Views (2016) sat atop the Billboard 200 for 13 nonconsecutive weeks, becoming the first album by a male solo artist to do so in over a decade, and featured the chart record-setting lead single "One Dance".[10] Marketed as a playlist, Drake's second solo commercial mixtape More Life (2017) set then-multiple streaming records.[11] In 2018, he released the double album Scorpion, which produced the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "God's Plan", "Nice for What", and "In My Feelings".[12]

                Departing Young Money in 2018, Drake's third commercial mixtape Dark Lane Demo Tapes was released in 2020, and featured the chart-topping "Toosie Slide". In 2021, the EP Scary Hours 2 included the number one single "What's Next" and set chart records, and preceded his delayed sixth album Certified Lover Boy (2021); the album set the record for most U.S. top-ten entries from one album, with lead single "Way 2 Sexy" becoming his ninth number one.[13]

As an entrepreneur, Drake founded the OVO Sound record label with longtime collaborator 40 in 2012. In 2013, Drake became the new "global ambassador" of the Toronto Raptors, joining the executive committee of the NBA franchise, while owning naming rights to its practice facility. In 2016, he began collaborating with American entrepreneur Brent Hocking on the bourbon whiskey Virginia Black; it eventually broke sale records in Canada.[14] Drake has also designed fashion, the most notable including a sub-label collaboration with Nike, alongside other business ventures. In 2018, he was reportedly responsible for 5% (CAD$440 million) of Toronto's CAD$8.8 billion total annual tourism income.
