# Portfolio

**Went through the first 5 chapters of the Markdown HTML and CSS Tutorial**<br/>
* Learned basic HTML and CSS syntax, hierarchy, semantics and formatting to populate, design, and style web pages<br/>
* I used what I learned to make a website found here. 
[My first site](test.html)<br/>
* On this sight I imbedded a link into an image, made use of both radio and normal buttons, and edited font size and color<br/>
* Added bootstrap to my VSCode and went through overview [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/forms/form-control/)<br/>
* Learned basics of bootstrap grid from [this link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-bootstrap-4-grid-system-in-10-minutes-e83bfae115da/)<br/>

# Change Log

* Went through first 5 chapters of following HTML and CSS Tutorial [here](https://marksheet.io)<br/>
* Made [My first site](test.html)<br/>
* Watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk12ELJ9Bww to link vscode and github to be able to push code to my repository from vscode.<br/>
* I ran into many errors when trying to link the two but was able to eventually get it problem solving on the internet.<br/>
* Implemented basic HTML and CSS into a webpage<br/>

# TODO

* Incorporate JavaScript to my code to allow the text box and buttons to recieve and process input.<br/>
* Eventually I want the site to tally the number of yes and no responses and display them. <br/>
* Also I want the site to print every reason for raising money and keep them all displayed on the page<br/>
* Use bootstrap to bolster the styling of the page.
