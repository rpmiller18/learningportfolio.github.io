# Portfolio

**Went through the first 5 chapters of the Markdown HTML and CSS Tutorial**<br/>
* Learned basic HTML and CSS syntax, hierarchy, semantics and formatting to populate, design, and style web pages<br/>
* I used what I learned to make a website found here. 
[My first site](test.html)<br/>
* On this sight I imbedded a link into an image, made use of both radio and normal buttons, and edited font size and color<br/>
* Added bootstrap to my VSCode and went through overview [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/forms/form-control/)<br/>
* Learned basics of bootstrap grid from [this link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-bootstrap-4-grid-system-in-10-minutes-e83bfae115da/)<br/>
* Made simple [rubric site](bootstraptest.html)<br/>

# Change Log

* Went through first 5 chapters of following HTML and CSS Tutorial [here](https://marksheet.io)<br/>
* Made [My first site](test.html)<br/>
* Watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk12ELJ9Bww to link vscode and github to be able to push code to my repository from vscode.<br/>
* I ran into many errors when trying to link the two but was able to eventually get it problem solving on the internet.<br/>
* Implemented basic HTML and CSS into a webpage<br/>
* I was able to get bootstrap running in my VSCode and made a simple site to conceptualize how to use the bootstrap grid to easily arrange information on a page<br/>
* The tutorial was grueling and taught me I didn't know as much about HTML and CSS as I had thought<br/>
* Took me about 5 hours to get through the tutorial but I made a sight that more closely mirrors one you might see on the internet<br/>
* Dove into how to properly use a header, body, and footer to display a webpage, how to make diverse classes on elements that allow you to make specific CSS styling rules.<br/>
* Updated site adding some JS processing. <br/>
* I wasn't able to make the changes I wanted as I was struggling with JS in the capacity I wanted to use it so I did the tutorial which claimed would incorporate javascript but never did <br/>
* Went through [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaVNP3nIAv0) making [a web browser rock paper scissors game](http://127.0.0.1:5500/rpsmain.html)

# TODO

* Incorporate JavaScript to my code to allow the text box and buttons to recieve and process input.<br/>
* Eventually I want the site to tally the number of yes and no responses and display them. <br/>
* Also I want the site to print every reason for raising money and keep them all displayed on the page<br/>
* Use bootstrap to bolster the styling of the page.
<br/>
<br/>

* Use javascript and type script to build an interactive site<br/>
* Incorporating react to bolster the capacity of a site<br/>
* Find a good tutorial that includes react and javascript and will alow me to build on progress in HTTP and CSS<br/>
